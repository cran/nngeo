Description: K-nearest neighbor search for projected and non-projected 'sf' spatial layers. Nearest neighbor search uses (1) C code from 'GeographicLib' for lon-lat point layers, (2) function knn() from package 'nabor' for projected point layers, or (3) function st_distance() from package 'sf' for line or polygon layers. The package also includes several other utility functions for spatial analysis.
Imports: nabor, units, methods, lwgeom, parallel, s2
Depends: R (>= 3.5.0), sf (>= 0.6)
